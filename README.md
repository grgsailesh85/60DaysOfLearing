# 60 Days of Learning: React JS, Next JS, and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to my 60 Days of Learning project! This repository is a collection of my daily progress as I embark on a 60-day journey to master front-end development using React JS, Next JS, and Tailwind CSS. As a recent Computer Engineering graduate, I'm excited to dive deep into these technologies and enhance my skills by building a variety of projects and components.

## About This Repository

This repository will be updated daily with the code, projects, and notes I create and learn throughout the 60 days. Each day's progress will include:

- **React JS**: Learning the core concepts, creating components, managing state, and building complex applications.
- **Next JS**: Exploring server-side rendering, static site generation, and creating dynamic web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and custom styling.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by day, with each folder containing the code and any associated documentation for that day's work. This structure will help track progress and provide a clear path of my learning journey.

## Goals

By the end of these 60 days, I aim to:
- Have a solid understanding of React JS, Next JS, and Tailwind CSS.
- Build and deploy several projects showcasing the skills I've learned.
- Document the learning process and share insights and resources that might help other learners.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the daily folders to see my progress. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or resources that could aid my learning, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
